----------------------------------

In this project you are going to develop a web-based database application system that provides service to its clients for storing, sharing, and searching their photos. The system, similar to flickr and PhotoShelter, can be used by its clients to:
* upload and store photos;
* enter and update the descriptive information for photos;
* specify the access privileges for your friends and/or public to share your photos;
* search for photos with given words and/or other specified conditions; and
* generate and display a data analysis report.
