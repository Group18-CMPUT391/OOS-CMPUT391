# If you want to alter your path, do it like this:
#
# PATH=$PATH\:some_directories
# export PATH
# 
# The same can be done for MANPATH and INFOPATH.
# It is _STRONGLY_ recommended that you add your stuff _AFTER_ the original
# path.
#
# Stuff you might want to add:
# /usr/local/pub{bin/man/lib}
# $HOME/bin
#
# Note that most paths are architecture specific, so you should use the
# case statement below.


# If you need to do any architecture specific stuff (including *PATH stuff),
# do it within a case statement like this:
#
# ( The sysadmins have defined a variable called DISTRO, that if you
# sourced the global RC file above it should be defined. )

#case $DISTRO in
#    slackware122)  # Any machine running Slackware 12.2
#        # Slackware 12.2 stuff
#	;;
#    ubuntu1204)  # Ubuntu 12.04
#        # Ubuntu 12.04 stuff
#	;;
#    undefined)  # if something has gone wrong and DISTRO
#                # is 'undefined' then do something safe.
#	;;
#esac
